\section{Momentum}

Suppose you are standing on a frictionless sled ($M_{you+sled} = 100$ kg) moving at 0.5 m/s.
You also have 22 blocks of mass 12 kg (i.e. $M_{total} = M_{you+sled}$ + 22(12 kg)).
You can boost your velocity by throwing the blocks horizontally at velocity 11 m/s in the opposite direction of your motion.
Create the following two plots: velocity vs the number of blocks thrown, and momentum vs the number of blocks thrown.

Run the following simulation to test your results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure you have Java JDK 1.8 installed
\item Download rocket-app.zip from https://github.com/naharrison/discrete-rocket/releases
\item Unzip the file and open rocket.jar
\item Click the green button to throw a block
\end{itemize}
