## Instructions for uploading lab reports to GitHub
* An assignment link will be sent by email, click the link and create a new (empty) repository
* Now you have to initialize the repository by adding a file. GitHub will do this for you if you click the README link:

* Next you'll see a window with some default text. You can modify or just leave it as it is. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green "Commit new file" button. This will initialize your repository and now you can add additional files by simply clicking the "Upload files" button:

* Important! Upload your lab reports as pdf files. Do not upload Word documents. (To convert from Word to pdf, do File -> Export...)
